# Kalman Filter Testing

Problem:

* The state estimation algorithms used by IrishSat (Notre Dame's sateliite club), are difficult to test using the physical prototype setup. The workshop changes too quickly (new sensors + builds), and the hardware is constantly breaking.

Solution:

* Comprehensive testing software that allows us to simulate and test our Kalman filters without being in person.

# About

Used to test state estimation software from https://github.com/ND-IrishSat/protosat-23-24, including our Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). 

These repo provides the infrastructure to simulate state estimation methods like Kalman filters and test their deployment, accuracy, and effiency.
